#Biomorpher
Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms for Rhino Grasshopper.
As opposed to metaheuristic algorithms requiring explicit objective functions (such as Galapagos), interactive evolutionary algorithms allow designers to engage with evolutionary development directly, forming a conversation with the machine. This allows for an involved experience, helping to explore the wide combinatorial space of parametric models without always knowing where you are headed!
